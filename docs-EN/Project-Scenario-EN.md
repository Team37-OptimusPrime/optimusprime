|Project Keywords|AI Workload, Energy Prediction, Virtual Machine, Power Modeling, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Energy Efficiency, Resource Optimization|
|Track|Research|
|Project Members|[Kang Si-yeon](https://github.com/uoehisx), [Kim Ji-yoon](https://github.com/horokkk), [Shin Woo-rim](https://github.com/RainyForest23)|
|Faculty Advisor|Professor Ban Hyo-kyung|
|What We Want to Build|AI-based Energy Consumption Prediction Model|
|Target Customer|Companies paying for cloud/server services|
|Pain Points|- Rapid increase in data center energy consumption due to the spread of generative AI<br> - GPU-intensive computing, large-scale parameter movement, and high-frequency I/O create energy usage patterns and bottlenecks by resource type (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) that differ from traditional workloads|
|Software Packages and Core Functions/Usage Scenarios|- Python 3.8+: Main development language <br> - PyTorch: AI model training/inference <br> - scikit-learn: Machine learning model implementation <br> - pandas/numpy: Data processing and analysis <br> - pynvml: NVIDIA GPU power monitoring|
|Software Package Names and URLs|- PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/<br> - scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/<br>- pynvml: https://pypi.org/project/pynvml/|
